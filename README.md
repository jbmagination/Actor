# Actor
The source code sadly isn't public yet-- I'm making sure that I can publish it and get it hosted somewhere, keep it updated and all that, without leaking the tokens. It'll be available ASAP <3

Actor is the best activities bot you'll ever use.

[Add the bot to your server now](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=891437279858540554&permissions=1&scope=bot%20applications.commands&response=code), or [join the server](https://top.gg/servers/887291094885339147)!

It supports more Discord activities than any other bot:
- *Actor*: **At least 12 Discord activities**, 23 at most
- *advaith's Activities bot*: 8 Discord activities
- *Discord Games Lab*: 8 Discord activities
- *Youtube Together*: At least 5 Discord activities, 7 at most
- *Philbert*: 5 activities
- *Voice Activities*: Most likely 5 Discord activities (was unable to test or get a full commands list)

And even if the bot doesn't update, *it doesn't have to*. Actor comes with custom activity support, so if you know an activity ID, you can use it.

Actor also comes with permissions. Don't want a specific role using it, or you want to prevent your server from using an activity? Use `/settings`. *Requires you to be the owner of the server, or have the Manage Server permission. If you can run `/settings`, you can use every activity anyway.*
