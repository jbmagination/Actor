# Privacy Policy
*Last updated on and effective as of September 30, 2021*

Actor collects a small amount of data from you to help make the bot better. I know, everyone says that, but seriously! It's *very* small. 

Since this isn't "legally binding", I, the developer, will also include *much* on why this information would be useful. I do genuinely care about your privacy because I care about mine. The data I collect by default is what I'd expect collected as a *user*, not as a *developer*, even if the info would be extremely helpful for me to develop the bot.

If you do share data that personally identifites yourself in some way (like your Discord user/ID), it isn't shared with anyone besides me and Discord without your permission-- **period**. If you are a server owner and want to have all non-essential data of your server removed, *or* a user who wants to have all data of themselves removed, please join the Actor Discord server and let me, JBMagination#5512 (`381862688298631168`) know.

**Storing permissions is required for Actor to work.** Whenever you add Actor to the server, and use a command, it automatically gets data from a database-- and this database is where permissions go. Thanks to Evie's Enmap, it automatically ensures that that data will be there whenever the data is retrieved. If this wasn't there, the bot just wouldn't work. This is because of role/activity permissions. When you start any activity, it first checks to see if it has permission to be run. Since it gets this information from the database to check if a value is true/false, it's going to automatically have *all* the values necessary for the bot to function. So, if these settings weren't stored, and you didn't have permission to run `/settings`, the bot would crash because everything it needs to verify that you can actually use the bot/activity wouldn't exist. If you remove Actor from your server, the settings are automatically deleted.

**If you choose to enable it, Actor automatically logs the ID of every activity played.** This is not associated with you or your account, it's only the activity ID. This allows me to discover new activities if you're using `/activity custom`, and as certain activities are being played more, I can bring them into `/activity common` or `/activity extra`. This file is publicly available. If you do or don't want to add to this, you can toggle it with `/privacy id`.

**Actor automatically collects data on errors.** This data is the error itself and the command that was run. That's it. I do this so I can diagnose errors (duh). The error by itself, however, isn't enough for me to be able to see an issue-- I also need to be able to see the command that was run so I can see both where the problem is, and if there's even one to begin with. If you do or don't want to report this, you can toggle it with  `/privacy error`.

**If you send non-anonymized feedback, your username, discriminator, and ID will also be given to me alongside the content of the feedback.** You as the user will be completely aware of this when you send feedback, as the name you're identified as will be displayed. I do this because  If you don't want that, feedback you send is anonymous by default. The only data I collect from anonymized feedback is the content of the feedback itself.

Thank you for using Actor!
